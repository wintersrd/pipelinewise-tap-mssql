# tap-mssql 2.6.0 2024-09-02
* Resolving issue LOG_BASED tables with special characters. Escaping the object
  names with double quotes. Issue #74
* Providing more flexibility with database connections to support newer
  SQL Server instances like PDW via option conn_properties config. Issue #28

# tap-mssql 2.5.0 2024-08-26

* removing tox-poetry-install - Not well supported.
* Updating integration tests vars to CAPS to support passing MSSQL Port
* tox-docker requires expose rather than ports syntax in tox.ini
* Bumping docker = "^6.1.3" -> "^7.1.0"
* Bumping pytest = "^7.0.0" -> "^8.3.2"
* Bumping pytest-cov = "^4.1.0" -> = "^5.0.0"
* Bumping mypy = "^1.10.1" -> = "^1.11.1"
* Bumping pytest-sugar = "^0.9.7" -> = "^1.0.0"
* Bumping pytest-datafiles = "^2.0" ->  = "^3.0"
* Bumping tox-docker = "4.1.0" ->  = "5.0.0"
* Bumping requests = "2.31.0" -> "2.32.3"

# tap-mssql 2.4.0 2024-08-08

* Moving to patched version of Singer Framework plus using msgspec rather than orjson for JSON serialization speed.
* Adjusting tox file for test pipeline to point to correct location of the sqlcmd in the latest MSSQL docker image.
* Adjusting tox file. Added -No switch calling sqlcmd to allow user/password connection to MSSQL.
* Patching dependencies.
* Pinned Requests to "2.31.0". This is required as the tox pipeline fails with a Docker API error with requests "2.32.x".
* Explicitly setting python version 3.8 -> 3.12
* Moving to using recommended poetry-core for build. https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#poetry-and-pep-517
* NOTE: Recommend refactoring to avoid using tox-poetry-installer as restrictive dependencies are stopping tox and docker updates. This may resolve the requests/docker api issue.

# tap-mssql 2.3.1 2024-07-22

* Bug Fix. Issue #62 - change to column selection using lists instead of sets to preserve column ordering

# tap-mssql 2.3.0 2024-04-18

* Bug Fix. Change pendulum DateTime type to datetime.datetime as pymssql 2.3.0 is no longer compatible with query parameters as pendulum DateTime (https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/issues/889)

# tap-mssql 2.2.3 2024-02-26

* Bug Fix. Enhancing singer-decimal output for numeric data to correctly output the correct datatype - string and precision.

# tap-mssql 2.2.1 2023-10-30

* Bug Fix. Removing test code which slipped into the release, and adjusting offending code with correct dynamic column name.

# tap-mssql 2.2.0 2023-08-23

This feature increases support for SQL Datatypes.

* Adds support for datetimeoffset - https://github.com/wintersrd/pipelinewise-tap-mssql/issues/50
* Resolves issue with datetime2 rounding with high precision timestamps https://github.com/wintersrd/pipelinewise-tap-mssql/issues/51
* Resolves the max and min range for tinyints. The current min and max are correct for MariaDB and MySQL only. MSSQL Server only supports
positive integers (unsigned tinyint). https://github.com/wintersrd/pipelinewise-tap-mssql/issues/2

# tap-mssql 2.1.0 2023-08-01

This is a number of new enhancements to extend capability and resolving a few bugs.

## Features
* Adds `use_singer_decimal` setting, capability i.e. the ability to output decimal, float, and integer data as strings to avoid loss of precision. A target like this custom [target-snowflake](https://github.com/mjsqu/pipelinewise-target-snowflake) can decode this back into numeric data.
* Ordering columns by their ordinal position so the schema matches the database definition
* Support for new `cursor_array_size` parameter. This allows fetching records in batches
speeding up network traffic. Recommend a setting of `10000` records.
* Fixing bug. We have encountered a scenario where a stream starts. It failed and there
 was no bookmark written.
When the job is re-run the state file had currently_syncing for the given stream but with
no bookmark written it didn't appear in the streams_with_state list. This small change will
ensure that the currently_syncing_list will be populated whether there is a bookmark or not
by filtering against the ordered_streams list which includes both streams_without_state and
streams_with_state.
* Removed test for "INCREMENTAL" and not primary_keys.
INCREMENTAL loads can be performed without primary keys as long as there
is a replication key.
* Updating the CDC documentation
* Fixing bug. Where encountered a scenario where state lsn == max lsn.
If the lsn coming from state is equal to the maximum lsn, then we should not be incrementing
this lsn as it causes errors in the `fn_cdc_get_all_changes` function.
* Fixing bug. The _sdc_lsn_operation should be 2 for Inserts not Deletes.
* Fixing bug. pymssql 2.2.8 does not work. Excluding this version from pyproject.toml.
* Feature. Adding a logo to the tap.
