# tap-mssql 2.2.0 2023-08-23

This feature increases support for SQL Datatypes.

* Adds support for datetimeoffset - https://github.com/wintersrd/pipelinewise-tap-mssql/issues/50
* Resolves issue with datetime2 rounding with high precision timestamps https://github.com/wintersrd/pipelinewise-tap-mssql/issues/51
* Resolves the max and min range for tinyints. The current min and max are correct for MariaDB and MySQL only. MSSQL Server only supports
positive integers (unsigned tinyint). https://github.com/wintersrd/pipelinewise-tap-mssql/issues/2

# tap-mssql 2.1.0 2023-08-01

This is a number of new enhancements to extend capability and resolving a few bugs.

## Features
* Adds `use_singer_decimal` setting, capability i.e. the ability to output decimal, float, and integer data as strings to avoid loss of precision. A target like this custom [target-snowflake](https://github.com/mjsqu/pipelinewise-target-snowflake) can decode this back into numeric data.
* Ordering columns by their ordinal position so the schema matches the database definition
* Support for new `cursor_array_size` parameter. This allows fetching records in batches
speeding up network traffic. Recommend a setting of `10000` records.
* Fixing bug. We have encountered a scenario where a stream starts. It failed and there
 was no bookmark written.
When the job is re-run the state file had currently_syncing for the given stream but with
no bookmark written it didn't appear in the streams_with_state list. This small change will
ensure that the currently_syncing_list will be populated whether there is a bookmark or not
by filtering against the ordered_streams list which includes both streams_without_state and
streams_with_state.
* Removed test for "INCREMENTAL" and not primary_keys.
INCREMENTAL loads can be performed without primary keys as long as there
is a replication key.
* Updating the CDC documentation
* Fixing bug. Where encountered a scenario where state lsn == max lsn.
If the lsn coming from state is equal to the maximum lsn, then we should not be incrementing
this lsn as it causes errors in the `fn_cdc_get_all_changes` function.
* Fixing bug. The _sdc_lsn_operation should be 2 for Inserts not Deletes.
* Fixing bug. pymssql 2.2.8 does not work. Excluding this version from pyproject.toml.
* Feature. Adding a logo to the tap.
